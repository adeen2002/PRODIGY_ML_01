I worked on a task involving the implementation of a linear regression model to predict house prices based on key features such as square footage, the number of bedrooms, and the number of bathrooms.
Data Preprocessing: I got hands-on experience with handling missing data and selecting relevant features, crucial steps in building any predictive model.
Model Implementation: I successfully trained and evaluated a linear regression model using Python and scikit-learn, deepening my understanding of how to derive insights from data.
Real-World Application: By analyzing the model's coefficients, I learned how different factors, like the size of a house or the number of bathrooms, influence its priceâ€”insights that are directly applicable in the real estate industry.
